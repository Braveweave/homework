# Cprogramming

Most code is written for my homework from the lecture `程序设计(1) (2)`.

## File Naming

Take `3.1.c` as example:

3 is the chapter number, and 1 is the problem number.

How about 3.1/1.c ?

Sometimes I may finish a problem with one more approachs, so all the source
code will be placed under a directory called `chapter_num.problem_num`. (Of
course, 0 comes the first.)
